    <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Agreement</h2>

      terms, do not use the App.

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
      English Proficiency is a mobile application designed to help users prepare
      for English proficiency exams (EPE, BUEPT, COPE, and others) offered by
      Turkish universities. The App provides practice questions, mock exams, and
      learning materials across multiple CEFR levels (A2-C1).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App offers the following auto-renewable subscription options:</p>
    <ul>

        unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Yearly Subscription:</strong> Automatically renews each year
        unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.

    <p>
      Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of
